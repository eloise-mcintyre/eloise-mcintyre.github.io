      <p class="top-and-middle">
        When creating a website, you have to name the different sections of your website in the code, so that you can both come back to it later and still understand what each of the bits do, and so that lots of stuff can be changed at once. In my website I had named the different sections with names that were less than useful, and when I went back to change things I had no idea what controlled what!  
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        To get myself out of this problem I started to ‘comment out’ different sections of my code, which means to stop that bit of code from working so that I could see what on my website disappeared/changed. Once I worked that out, I wrote comments to show what the different sections were, so that this issue wouldn’t happen again. Throughout this process I felt silly that I had named everything so badly in the first place, but recognized that it was a good mistake to make early on, so that I could learn from it. What I learned was to name the different code sections with descriptive class names, and add comments to explain where the code was a bit tricky to follow.

      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs"> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way:</h4>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        I had to write a function that took in a group of numbers and returned the same numbers except those that were multiples of 3, it printed Fizz, those that are multiples of 5 printed Buzz, and those that were multiples of 3 and 5 printed FizzBuzz. I knew the gist of what the code needed to do, but instead of jumping straight into coding we were meant to write pseudocode. I wrote the pseudocode) and as I did so it allowed me to fully understand how the function needed to flow. Then when writing the actual code, I got the function right first time. This made me feel like I’d done a really thorough job and made the whole process fun. This taught me that thinking through a problem in its entirety before coding was a much better method compared to just hacking away at the code until it works.   
        </p>

      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs"> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Pseudocode: </strong> I feel somewhat confident using this method of problem solving - It works well when I do use it, but need to use it more to feel as though it comes naturally to me.
        </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Trying Something: </strong> Confident using this method! Though certainly wouldn't say that what I try works! :)
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Rubber Ducky Method: </strong> Have been giving the rubber ducky method a go recently by talking through my thinking out loud, so certainly getting more confident with this method!
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Reading Error Messages: </strong> Not a super confident one for me... I often forget and have to go back and read the error message (and often realise that it tells me exactly what I need to do to fix the problem). Need to work on this one!
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Console.logging: </strong> Pretty confident with console.logging! It's probably one of the first methods I learned to problem solve so have used it a bit. 
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Googling: </strong> I'm confident using this method!! Googling is second nature to me these days. Although still find it hard sometimes to separate the good resources from the bad/overly complicated ones. 
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong> Semi-confident with asking peers for help. I have to get over my mental barrier of feeling like I'm giving up or asking a dumb question. 
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong> Similar to asking peers for help - I can do it but it doesn't come super naturally to me. I imagine that this will change as things ramp up during bootcamp!
      </p>

      <p class="bottom-paragraph">
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong> I am confident on the reflecting side, but don't feel as though i've been able to practice this much as I haven't had the time to go back and make the changes I've reflected on. Hopefully I can put this in to practice soon!
      </p>
