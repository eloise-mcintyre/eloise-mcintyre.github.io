      <p class="top-and-middle">
        When creating a website, you have to name the different sections of your website in the code, so that you can both come back to it later and still understand what each of the bits do, and so that lots of stuff can be changed at once. In my website I had named the different sections with names that were less than useful, and when I went back to change things I had no idea what controlled what!  
      </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
        To get myself out of this problem I started to ‘comment out’ different sections of my code, which means to stop that bit of code from working so that I could see what on my website disappeared/changed. Once I worked that out, I wrote comments to show what the different sections were, so that this issue wouldn’t happen again. Throughout this process I felt silly that I had named everything so badly in the first place, but recognized that it was a good mistake to make early on, so that I could learn from it. What I learned was to name the different code sections with descriptive class names, and add comments to explain where the code was a bit tricky to follow.
