      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs"> HTML vs CSS</h4>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
          You can think of the difference between HTML and CSS as being similar to the process of getting a big, colored tattoo. In the first session, you generally get an outline of the tattoo in black – this gives the general shape and size of the tattoo but lacks detail and definition. This is just like HTML – all the content is there, but none of the styling. In the next session you go and get color and shading added to the tattoo. This is similar to CSS, which enhances HTML by giving it color, changing the shape, size, placement, etc!

      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs"> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h4>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
          Control flow describes the order that code is executed by the computer. Normally the code is read from top to bottom UNLESS there are special terms that can change the ordering of the flow. For example, the control flow can be adjusted by ‘if’ statements. Here is an example – “If you have >$100 in your account you can buy lunch” – In coding terms that would be, for example, if x is > 100, execute this bit of code, otherwise carry on as normal. An ‘if else’ statement would be something like “if you have >$100 you can buy lunch, otherwise (else) bring your lunch from home”. If else statements can have as many different requirements as you want so are a great way of executing the right code at the right time!     
        </p>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
          Loops is the term used to describe a piece of code that is run over and over until a condition is met. An example for this in the real world would be “you have to do every item on your to-do list until it is completed, then you can go to bed”. This allows you to shorten what would be a lot of lines of code into one or two lines.

      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs"> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h4>

      <p class="top-and-middle">
          The DOM, or Document Object Model is a tree-like representation of HTML documents that allows the document to be manipulated by other languages/scripts. You can imagine the process to be similar to that of actually climbing a tree – you can’t just jump straight to the outer-most leaves and branches – first you need to climb up the trunk and out to the canopy before reaching the ends. This is essentially what the DOM represents too – the layout of accessing these various regions.    
        </p>

        <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
        <p class="top-and-middle">
            Arrays are created by stating a variable followed by values enclosed in square brackets, separated by commas. The values are assigned a number that can then be used to access the array, with the first value in an array starting with zero. To access a value in an array you first state the variable, followed by an opening square bracket, the number of the value you want to access, and then a closing bracket. Objects are created by creating a variable and then an opening curly bracket. After this, you need to assign a key on the left hand side followed by a colon, and then the value you want to assign to the key. You can then access the object by calling the variable followed by a dot and then the key for the value you want to access. See the photo below for an example of creating and accessing objects and arrays, 
        </p>

      <h4 class="headers-of-tech-blogs">What Functions Are, And Why Theyre Useful</h4>
      <p class="top-and-middle">
        Functions are one of, if not the most, useful tools in coding. Functions are essentially bits of code that can be used over and over by being called. Functions have ‘parameters’, which are placeholder text that is then entered as arguments when the function is called. This is shown in the example below, where the function ‘addNumbers’ adds two numbers together, which are passed into the function when it is called.

      <p class="bottom-paragraph">
        While this is a super simple example, functions can do really complicated things, and allow much more condensed code, as you can repeat the block of code over and over by simply calling the function rather than re-writing it every time.
