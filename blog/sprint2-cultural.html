    <h3 class="core-header">My Medium and Long Term Career Goals</h3>

        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            My medium career goal is to be a GOOD software developer, working for a company who value their employees, their product and efficiency, and to enjoy my job. My long term career pathway will be to combine my love of environmental conservation with software development, working in a roll where I can make a difference to the conservation of New Zealand’s native Flora and Fauna THROUGH technology. This may involve going back to Uni in the future to study genetics.         
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="core-header">Human Skills to Develop</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            The biggest skill I want to develop during EDA is taking criticism better. I want to approach feedback with a much more positive mindset, rather than dwelling that I didn’t get it right the first time, or being defensive. This is something I have struggled with in the past!            
        </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Strengths and Weaknesses and Managing My Workload</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            As described in my identity, values and strengths blog (see blog for more detail), three of my main strengths include reliability, altruism and emotional intelligence. My two main weaknesses include internalizing other peoples problems in a way that can be paralyzing, and difficulty making tough decisions.             
        </p>
    
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
             During foundations I will manage my workload by giving my day to day life structure, as structure is the only way for me to plan my time when the learning is all remote. During bootcamp I will manage my workload by being a reliable and empathetic team player. I will ask for help during classes, and will post questions on Slack if struggling with concepts while I’m away from campus. I will continue to use Toggl to track my time so that I know if I am spending too much or too little time on each concept.             
         </p>
    
    <h3 class="core-header">Expectation of Facilitators</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            From the Facilitation team I expect support where needed, and an ear to listen with. I expect facilitators to take it seriously if I say that I’m struggling and to provide me with the tools to help myself. I expect positive feedback when deserved and feedback for areas of improvement where necessary.             
        </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Scheduling Priorities </h3>
         <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
            I have no significant scheduling priorities aside from yoga (Thursday nights at 7:30pm) and having enough me time to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I would like to get home from boot camp with enough time to cook at least a day or two a week, as cooking for me is a great stress relief and bonding time with my partner.
