    <h2 class="core-header">ANSWERS FOR BOOTCAMP </h2>
    <h3 class="core-header">My Medium and Long Term Career Goals </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
    My medium and long term careers goals are still the same as when I started foundations. In the medium term I simply want to be a good software developer and enjoy my job, while in the long term I want to combine my love for tech and conservation as a career.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What Will Be My Biggest Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp?> </h3>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        My biggest strength will be my ability to work with others. I love collaborating and being part of a team, and given the amount of team work involved in bootcamp, I think this will be a big strength for me. One of my biggest weaknesses will be the possibility of feeling too overwhelmed with the workload. Sometimes if I get too stressed with workload I can freeze and find it hard to change back to a positive mindset.         
      </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What will be my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        My biggest non-tech challenge will likely be letting go of the idea that I will be able to understand everything fully before moving on to the next concept. Normally when learning you have time to revise content and consolidate it before moving on, but given the time limitations of the course that will probably not be possible.        
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Human Skills to Develop During Bootcamp? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      I want to develop my ability to take criticism more positively, and not respond defensively. Additionally I want to be a better listener and be less selfish during conversations - paying more attention to not interupting and really listening to what the other person has to say.      
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What Are My Expecations From The Bootcamp Team? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      My expectations from the bootcamp team are similar to those I had from my foundations team - I expect support where needed, and an ear to listen with. I expect the team to take it seriously if I say that I’m struggling and to provide me with the tools to help myself. I expect positive feedback when deserved and feedback for areas of improvement where necessary.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What Are My Expecations Of Myself During Bootcamp? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      I expect myself to be driven to learn. I expect myself to ask my peers for help, and also provide help where I can. I will ask my tutors for help when after I have tried to work out the problems myself. I expect to feel frustrated at times but generally happy about the learning process. I expect to keep on top of my workload and put some of my personal life aside so I can prioritise getting through bootcamp. I expect myself to be a good team member and not be too bossy. 
    </p>


    <h2 class="core-header">ANSWERS FOR FOUNDATIONS </h2>
    <h3 class="core-header">My Medium and Long Term Career Goals </h3>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        My medium career goal is to be a GOOD software developer, working for a company who value their employees, their product and efficiency, and to enjoy my job. My long term career pathway will be to combine my love of environmental conservation with software development, working in a roll where I can make a difference to the conservation of New Zealand’s native Flora and Fauna THROUGH technology. This may involve going back to Uni in the future to study genetics.         
      </p>

    
    
    <h3 class="core-header">Human Skills to Develop</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            The biggest skill I want to develop during EDA is taking criticism better. I want to approach feedback with a much more positive mindset, rather than dwelling that I didn’t get it right the first time, or being defensive. This is something I have struggled with in the past!            
        </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Strengths and Weaknesses and Managing My Workload</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            As described in my identity, values and strengths blog (see blog for more detail), three of my main strengths include reliability, altruism and emotional intelligence. My two main weaknesses include internalizing other peoples problems in a way that can be paralyzing, and difficulty making tough decisions.             
        </p>
    
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
             During foundations I will manage my workload by giving my day to day life structure, as structure is the only way for me to plan my time when the learning is all remote. During bootcamp I will manage my workload by being a reliable and empathetic team player. I will ask for help during classes, and will post questions on Slack if struggling with concepts while I’m away from campus. I will continue to use Toggl to track my time so that I know if I am spending too much or too little time on each concept.             
         </p>
    
    <h3 class="core-header">Expectation of Facilitators</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            From the Facilitation team I expect support where needed, and an ear to listen with. I expect facilitators to take it seriously if I say that I’m struggling and to provide me with the tools to help myself. I expect positive feedback when deserved and feedback for areas of improvement where necessary.             
        </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Scheduling Priorities </h3>
         <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
            I have no significant scheduling priorities aside from yoga (Thursday nights at 7:30pm) and having enough me time to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I would like to get home from boot camp with enough time to cook at least a day or two a week, as cooking for me is a great stress relief and bonding time with my partner.
