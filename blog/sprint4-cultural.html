    <h3 class="core-header">Neuroplasticity</h3>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the brain to create new pathways and strengthen them through practice. Neuroplasticity is one of the most useful things that humans are capable of and, aside from our genetic talents, which we have no say over, it encompasses the process of everything else that we learn. Because of this, its benefit to people is second-to-none – it’s how we learn to ride a bike, how we learn to speak and write, how we learn to cook and remember our favourite recipes without having to even think about it. You name it – most of the things we do are possible only because of the brains ability to be more efficient and create pathways through practice.          
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Understanding neuroplasticity can be extremely beneficial to the learning process. The awareness that your brain is capable of change allows for a much more positive attitude and increased resilience when encountering difficulty during learning. This is because you are aware that while you might not know how to do it now, if you practice the process enough, it will get easier – it’s a physiological fact. You can engage with neuroplasticity during learning by thinking about it whenever you are struggling, as this will help you to push through over and over again until you can do it.         
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Three examples for increasing neuroplasticity are getting enough sleep, reducing stress, and learning and exercising. Sleep is the brains chance to gather up all the information that you experience during the day, and solidifying this is into neural pathways. Because of this, getting enough sleep is super important, especially when actively learning new skills. When the brain/body is stressed, your body puts more resources into the fight or flight responses – increasing blood flow to the muscles, increasing adrenaline, lowering the immune system, and wiring the brain to be thinking in the here and now, not the learning process. While this is useful if you’re in imminent danger, for example being chased by a Tiger, it’s harmful to all other aspects of daily life, including learning new things – reduce stress and your brain will thank you. Constantly learning new things and being active are also key as it keeps good blood flow to the brain and causes lots of neural firing, preventing the ‘trimming down’ of neurons.

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        An amazing resource that demonstrates just how malleable the brain can be was the recovery of a woman called <a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/girl-with-half-her-brain-becomes-speech-pathologist-as-an-adult/">Christina Santhouse</a>. She suffered from Rasmussen’s Encephalitis, which caused 150 seizures a day. At 8 years old she had the entire right hemisphere of her brain removed, as it was the only way to cure the disease. This paralysed her left side but she was able to learn how to walk and talk again, and now, at 32 years old, she has a Masters degree in speech pathology, she has two kids, she owns a house, and the only traits she still has from having only half a brain is a slight limp, and issues controlling her left arm. The left side of her brain was able to almost fully compensate for the loss of its other half, which just shows the incredible ability of the brain to re-structure and re-wire.

    <h3 class="core-header">The Growth Mindset</h3>
        
      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        The growth mindset describes a persons way of thinking. Someone with a growth mindset believes that they are able to get smarter, thus when encountering something that they don’t know how to do, they tackle the problem positively, with the belief that they can learn it. This is in contrast to the fixed mindset, where a person believes they are not capable of change and so when encountering difficult problems, they find the situation devastating and give up, instead spending their time trying not to appear as though they can’t. The growth mindset is relevant as it ties nicely in with neuroplasticity, and it teaches you that you are capable and responsible for your own learning. Having a growth mindset can be as simple as changing your perspective, but it essential to the learning process.       
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        During the exploration of the growth mindset it made me realise that while I would consider myself to have that mindset, it could be much stronger. While I’m aware of being capable of learning and change, I could do better with tackling problems with positivity and patience. In order to better integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey I will need to keep the growth mindset and neuroplasticity more central in my thoughts, and remember that every challenge is an opportunity for growth, rather than just another hurdle.        
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        I found an article by <a href="https://ideapod.com/fixed-vs-growth-the-two-basic-mindsets-that-shape-our-lives/">Ideapod</a> that talked about the traits of people with fixed vs growth mindsets interesting, as I didn’t fall completely into one category. Most of my traits were growth mindset, e.g. “does not let one mistake or setback define their potential” and “believe that hard work is essential because natural talent is simply not enough”. However, I do sometime have the traits of a fixed mindset, e.g. “lose interest when a task becomes harder”. It made me think more about how these things need to be constantly worked on in order to have the right outlook.         
      </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">How can this affect my learning plan? </h3>

      <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
        Based on this research, I am now going to keep the idea of neuroplasticity and growth mindset in the front of my mind when I’m learning. In doing so, I hope to better tackle problems that I find particularly difficult and will give up less easily as know that the challenges are good for me and I will remind myself that I don’t want to slip back into a fixed mindset.
