    <h4 class="title-of-sprint-2">What are the best practices associated with using classes and ID's?</h4>
    <p>
      Classes and ID's are two essential HTML tags that allow for structured styling in CSS. The Syntax of each can be seen below:

    <p>
      Both the class and ID selector are used to identify elements that may need styling through CSS, while also providing names that give insight into what is being coded - however they should be used in different circumstances.    
    </p>
    <p>
      The ID selector can only be used once for any given name, while you can use as many class selectors under the same name as you want. This means that class selectors are used when you want to assign multiple elements with the same class – for example, you may want to assign all pictures with the same class so that they are always formatted the same way through CSS. Since ID selectors can only be used once for a given name, they should be used when assigning an element that needs unique styling properties.
