    <h3 class="core-header">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Emotional intelligence can be defined as a person’s ability to understand, express, and control their own emotions, and to understand and be empathetic to the emotions and intentions of others. It also relates to one’s ability to fine-tune their emotions to better reflect and take advantage of their environment.

    <h3 class="core-header">How is Emotional Intelligence Difference from Intellectual Intelligence?</h3>
        
      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        EQ and IQ can be considered to be pretty much separate. IQ evaluates a person’s cognitive ability in terms of capability of using logic, solving problems and memory ability, among other standard intelligence related parameters. EQ on the other hand, as described above, relates to understanding and controlling your own emotions and understanding and adapting to the emotions of others – having good ‘people skills’. A person could be very high in either EQ or IQ, but low in the other – having a certain score in one does not have any influence on the score of the other.         
      </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Why is Emotional Intelligence Important? </h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Historically, it was argued that being successful in life was primarily related to a person having a high IQ, or general intelligence. This is reflected in the school system – Most classes are related to academic learning, with solving problems and having a good memory being a key advantage. However, it has come to light in recent decades that being ‘super smart’ was not necessarily the best predictor for success, and certainly not the best predictor for happiness.

      <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
        Understanding more about emotional intelligence has become more popular as the world has become more business rich, and as people with high EQ are more and more often in positions of power. Emotional intelligence allows for better relationships with people and allows for better adjustment to emotional situations, which comes in handy when dealing with groups of people, such as being a team leader. Emotional intelligence is also a big benefit for your own happiness – being more aware of your emotions, why you feel the way you do, and being more able to control your emotions can really help during times of stress or sadness.
