    <h3 class="core-header">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        The first thing I learned was that I wasn’t a great listener! As with many people, I had spent a lot of my time “listening” thinking about how I could get into the conversation, how I could interject with my own experiences. Doing the listening and looping made me realise that I have a lot to improve on when it comes to listening!        
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        The second thing I learned was that being more aware of how plastic my brain is will help to accelerate my learning journey. Sometimes I still get stuck with the idea that “I can’t do it” and need to remind myself that it’s possible for me to learn just about anything if I put my mind to it and force those neural pathways into existence!       
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        The third thing I learned was that I’m lacking a bit in my ability to ask for help from my peers and my tutors as a method of problem solving. I need to get over my ego once the bootcamp starts so that I can better utilize the knowledge of the people around me when I encounter problems.         
      </p>


    <h3 class="core-header">What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        
      <p class="blog-paragraphs">
        Values, empathy and self-awareness are super important in programming because programming is a team discipline! Values are important because it helps to reflect on your own values and those of your team when developing a product. Self-awareness is important to learning as it helps with being aware of how much you know and what you still need to learn, and helps to be more receptive to how you behave in a team environment. Empathy is important to working well with other people, which is a big advantage to any team situation, not just in programming.      
      </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      Some of the stats that we learned about were surprising, for example the fact that EQ was a better predictor of success than IQ. It was amazing to learn that so many centuries of assumptions about intelligence and success were not exactly correct, and that we can learn to have better EQ and increase our chances of success within companies.        
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      It was a little challenging putting time into core when it felt like I would struggle more with the coding work than with the core work. While I knew that the core work was important, it was difficult to put the correct amount of effort in to ensure I was learning both core and coding at the right pace. For some of the sprints I didn’t do the core work until the end and couldn’t put as much time into it as I wanted to.       
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Why do you think we are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development course? </h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
      The core work we learned were all to help us become more employable. Neuroplasticity, empathy, values etc, it’s all stuff that makes us valuable as employees and will allow us to produce more meaningful products and be happier and more effective working in teams. Dev Academy (thankfully) cares about us getting jobs when we graduate, and to give us the best chance of that we need to know the people side of working as well as the technical side of coding.         
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-header">Does the time you spent studying core feel like a waste of time? Should you have used that time practicing programming instead? </h3>

      <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
        It doesn’t feel like a waste of time to me! Core so far has taught me where some of my strengths are and where I could improve. It also got me to research some of the concepts like EQ and neuroplasticity which were really interesting and has made me more motivated to work on those areas. I recently had a job interview and I talked about some of this stuff, essentially how I was technically lacking (I mean I was only on week 3 of foundations at the time!), but I talked about how I worked with people and some of the core concepts we learned at Dev Academy and they were impressed! They said it set Dev Academy apart from regular university.
