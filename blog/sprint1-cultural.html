    <h3 class="core-header">My Values</h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            My main values are advocacy and family. My value of advocacy comes from being the advocate for my family. My parents split when I was young, and my mum has been unwell for a long time which meant that I advocated for her health when she couldn’t. This led to me being super protective of my family and gave me a real reason to value speaking out! I personally think that voicing concerns or opportunities for improvement is the only way to make change, even if you don’t succeed. Most of the time, my advocacy for others was well recieved, but sometimes I took other peoples problems on too seriously, and overstepped - This is something i'm certainly working on!

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">
            Recently at work, I had noticed a friend being overloaded, she was really struggling and it was causing her to slowly hate her job. I spoke to her about it and she wasn’t prepared to talk to her manager about it, but that I could – she had already starting looking for other jobs. I spoke to the manager and explained that it was obvious that her workload was too high and that she was really struggling. The manager was quite put out that I was taking on her battle for her, but it opened the line of conversation and allowed for my friends situation improve. While I don’t regret my decision, if I could go back I would have encouraged my friend to speak to the manager herself much more strongly, as it would have been better for the both of them.

    <h3 class="core-header">My Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
    
        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
                My strengths and weaknesses can be summed up quite well by the personality I was assigned using the Myers Briggs 16 personalities test – The protagonist.  <em>“Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community.”</em>

        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
                While this is probably more of an idealistic view of who I am, it does sum up my main strengths, and those strengths also lead on to my main weaknesses. 
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Three of my main strengths include reliability, altruism and emotional intelligence. I absolutely hate letting people down, particularly if it involves people or causes I care about, and as such I do everything possible to keep my word. My value for advocacy has also made me altruistic – I love helping people and seeing them thrive. Another strength of mine is my ability to read the emotions of others and adapt my behavior accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>Two of my main weaknesses include internalizing other people’s problems and trouble making tough decisions. My altruism for other people can often work against me as I have trouble separating other people’s problems from my own and this can sometimes be paralyzing – particularly if it involves my family. I can also have trouble making decisions - If stuck between two decisions that both affect something I’m passionate about, I’m prone to freezing and being unable to make any decision at all, which has a negative effect to the very things I am trying to protect.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraphs">
                I believe the strength that will help me most on my learning journey and future career is emotional intelligence. Understanding other’s emotions is a big advantage for building meaningful relationships and working in teams. Understanding emotions can also help in situations with difficult people as it allows better navigation of the situation.

        <p class="bottom-paragraph-core">
            Recently I was in a situation at work where our chief engineers had given our team a project with extremely unrealistic target features given the timeline. While our team did our best to add the features, there was constant pressure and tension between our team and the chief engineers. I spent a lot of time advocating for more resource on the project in meetings, explaining with clear timing plans that the time-line was not plausible, but nothing ever changed. Eventually the project was delivered, but with considerable compromises in features. When reflecting on this situation, we should have approached the chiefs as a united front, explaining that the issue was widely felt - this would have likely gained much more traction.
